                    <p>Logged into our accounts on the computers. We did a brief history lesson on computers and learned how molecules move</p>

                    <span class="date">July 11, 2017</span>
                    <p>Started to learn how to program in the C programming language. We learned the syntax, if-else statements, and loops. We did a few simple programs to practice our newfound skills</p>

                    <p>In the biophysics lecture, we talked about polar and non polar molecules in a cell as well as the different major molecules in a cell. In the programming time, we made a simple program to calculate quadratic roots as well as factorials</p>

                    <p>We started learning about another programming language called Python today. We learned the basic syntax, and remade the factorial program using Python</p>

                    <p>Today we went more in dept into python. We got into defining variables, lists and learning the syntax for more logic-based statements</p>

                    <p>This class, we learned how to plot graphs using a subset of the python library Matplotlib, called Pyplot. We graphed the plots of the functions sin(x) and cos(x)</p>

                    <p>We worked on transcribing DNA in RNA, and then translating that following RNA code into a sequence of amino acids today. We also made a population graph with a prey and a predator, using lynxes and hares as the example</p>

                    <p>Today we discussed the probability theorem, and how in theory, to an extent, random walks is essentially just modeling probability. We also talked about 2 useful formulas, the Einstein-Stokes formula and Pascal's triangle</p>

                    <p>This class, we created a program to simulate how many games it would take for a gambler to go broke. We modeled this simulation with a graph. Also, the class learned other probability situations as well as estimating Ï€ using circles</p>

                    <p>Today, we simluated one-dimensional random walks. The program displayed a line graph as well as a histogram. The program also had the capability to display multiple random walks simultaneously. The class also started 2D random walks, which were very similar, except had an additional axis of movement available</p>

                    <p>We continued to work on the two-dimensional walks today. We added targets that the walkers had to reach and recorded the number of steps that it took. We also added limits to simulate a cell, showing that at a certain point, the walker would simply bounce back and that it would stay within a certain range</p>
