  Today in robotics we continued to work on our robots and the software side of it. So far I have been able to finish the Square
  and 4 Square challenges. Next I plan on going back to Circle and then finishing it off with Figure 8. Right now, I have learned how to
  use the encoders on the motors and access them in the code to make movement much easier. However, there still is an element of guessing
  and checking that won't be fullfilled until we figure out how exactly the gyro sensor works in the code.
