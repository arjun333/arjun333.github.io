                    <p>Built the base robot and started programming the robot in NXC. Made the robot move forward as well as turn in somewhat a circle</p>

                    <p>Continued programming the robot and learned that using the encoders is useful for more precise movements. I programmed the Square and the 4 Square program. I started to work on making the robot drive around in a circle</p>

                    <p>Today we went to Schilling Robotics. They develop robotic arms and ROVs, Remotely Operated Vehicles. The ROVs are used for underwater functions and can go up 6,000km underwater. In the afternoon, I finished the Circle and Figure 8 programs, as well as making the robot draw the first letter of my last name. In the end, I had just enough time to write, but not test code, for the obstacle course</p>

                    <p>Continued working on the obstacle course. Had many difficulties with the turning and became very frustrated. Still haven't finished the challenge.</p>

                    <p>Spent the entire day working on the robots. Still haven't gotten the obstacle course program to work, no matter how many times I make reasonable modifications to the code</p>

                    <p>Kept working on the obstacle course, but decided to jump back and forth between the Line Follower and the obstacle course because of how long the obstacle course was taking me. By the end of the day, I got the Line Follow program to work and finished that challenge</p>

                    <p>I got the program that play Happy Birthday as you cross lines to work today, as well as finally finishing the obstacle course after a week of trying. I started to build the mechanism for the final challenge; shooting a basketball. I also started brainstorming ideas for the final project robot</p>

                    <p>The Professor to just start building our final project instead of working on the basketball challenge. We started building the Personal Assistant by build the drivebase, a stair climber. It works, but it can't turn, a challenge we plan to address tomorrow</p>

                    <p>Today, Prasanth and Adrian started working on making the wheels able to turn using a differential while I worked on getting the IR sensor to work. The sensor kept giving me inaccurate and wrong values which was certainly a challenge</p>

                    <p>The IR sensor still doesn't work properly, but I got a very basic version working somehow. The sensor is moved by a motor to face the direction of the IR beacon. This doesn't work all the time, but is decently consistent</p>

                    <p>Today we went to DMG Mori, a German and Japanese manufacturing company with a facility in Davis. The assembly line and entire area was huge and it was a very interesting place and a great outing. In the afternoon, I started to get the IR beacon remote control buttons to work</p>

                    <p>I got the IR beacon remote control to work well, but it would be laggy. The solution was to use a toggle mechanism, which prevented the lag from occuring</p>

                    <p>We got the entire robot built today so I started to program the stair climber part. After many iterations and additions, I got the robot to climb up the stairs, but would tip over after a couple seconds</p>
